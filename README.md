# rescue-fatfinger

This repo is about rescuing a fatfinger transaction generator who made a catastrophic mistake when setting the gas and gas-price.

## Reasoning of rescue

- fees/gas/gas-price is a very confusing concept for normal users.
- gaiacli is not well-documented for normal users.
- Cosmos team suggested delegators to use gaiacli although there was no perfect documentation of it.
- There was no easy & secure way to generate and broadcast a transaction in early cosmoshub-1
